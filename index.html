            <p>The origins of Topsail Beach as a small coastal fishing town is evident at the Jolly Roger Fishing Pier, where king mackerel fisherman demonstrate their fishing skills at the very end of the pier or spot fisherman stand shoulder to shoulder in the fall.  For those who prefer fishing off shore or a sunset cruise, you can make a reservation on the headboat Queen Jean.</p>
